# kafka-consumer

Pure java kafka consumer.  This example is drawn from https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/KAFKA/Consumer+Group+Example for version 0.8.2.1 of kafka, but actually compiles.

The runtime currently expects you to have the kafka distribution in a sister directory, and to have set up a simple test queue as outlined here: https://kafka.apache.org/documentation.html#quickstart
